CUDA (Compute Unified Device Architecture) is a parallel computing platform and programming model developed by NVIDIA that enables developers to use GPUs for general-purpose computation. It provides direct access to the GPUâ€™s massive parallel processing capabilities.

Triton is a programming language developed by OpenAI that simplifies writing high-performance GPU programs, similar to CUDA but with a focus on ease of use and optimization for modern AI workloads.
